## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/schedlyx.git
cd schedlyx
```

### 2. Set Up Development Environment

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### 3. Create a Branch

```bash
# Create a new branch for your feature/fix
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
```

## 📋 Development Guidelines

### Code Style

We use ESLint and Prettier for consistent code formatting:

```bash
# Check linting
npm run lint

# Fix linting issues
npm run lint:fix

# Format code
npm run format
```

### Commit Messages

Follow conventional commits format:

```
feat: add user authentication
fix: resolve calendar sync issue
docs: update API documentation
style: format code with prettier
refactor: simplify booking logic
test: add unit tests for scheduling
```

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Define proper types and interfaces
- Avoid `any` type when possible

### Component Guidelines

- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused
- Use proper prop types
- Include JSDoc comments for complex components

```tsx
interface BookingCardProps {
  /** The booking data to display */
  booking: Booking;
  /** Callback when booking is cancelled */
  onCancel: (bookingId: string) => void;
}

/**
 * Displays a booking card with cancel functionality
 */
export function BookingCard({ booking, onCancel }: BookingCardProps) {
  // Component implementation
}
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Writing Tests

- Write unit tests for utilities and hooks
- Write integration tests for complex components
- Use React Testing Library for component tests
- Mock external dependencies (Supabase, APIs)

Example test:

```tsx
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { BookingCard } from './BookingCard';

describe('BookingCard', () => {
  it('displays booking information', () => {
    const mockBooking = {
      id: '1',
      title: 'Team Meeting',
      date: '2024-01-15',
    };

    render(<BookingCard booking={mockBooking} onCancel={jest.fn()} />);
    
    expect(screen.getByText('Team Meeting')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```
